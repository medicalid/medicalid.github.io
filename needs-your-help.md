        The free version of the app is made possible because people like you are supporting the development and the 
        maintenance of the app. What do we mean by <em>supporting</em>? it ranges from kind words Laurent receives 
        every day (thanks people ðŸ’–), great comments on Google Play,
         <a href="https://www.transifex.com/medicalid/medicalid/" title="Help translating Medical ID" alt="Help translating Medical ID">help with translations</a>, people who upgrade to 
         the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.medicalid" title="Get Medical ID - Premium version">premium version of the app</a>, to some <a href="https://www.paypal.me/lpellegr" title="Make a donation to support Medical ID" alt="Make a donation to support Medical ID">rare donations</a>.

        Unfortunately, that is not enough to keep the app alive. For the benefit of all, we want to keep a free version 
        of the application, so we investigated solutions. In contrary to advertisements, which we think are too 
        intrusive and do not make sense for Medical ID, we start asking users of the free version only if they would mind 
        sharing occasionally their anonymized location position for research and marketing purposes. 
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Your medical data is not shared with third-parties and never will!</strong></p>
    
    <p>
        What happens if you accept to occasionally share your anonymized location? 
        Your device will from time to time send your anonymized position to our partner huq.io.
        Medical data or personally identifiable information is not shared and never will.
        The solution is 100% user-privacy compliant and has very low battery consumption.
